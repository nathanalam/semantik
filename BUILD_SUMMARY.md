# Build Summary

## âœ… Setup Complete!

Your PDF Search application is ready to build and distribute.

## What Was Created

### Application Files
- âœ… `app_readonly.py` - Production version (read-only, for distribution)
- âœ… `pdf_search.spec` - PyInstaller configuration
- âœ… `build.sh` - Build script for macOS/Linux
- âœ… `build.bat` - Build script for Windows

### Documentation
- âœ… `README.md` - Main documentation (updated)
- âœ… `PACKAGING.md` - Complete packaging guide
- âœ… `QUICKSTART.md` - End-user guide
- âœ… `BUILD_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Verified Components
- âœ… Storage directory exists (28 files, ~11MB)
- âœ… PDFs directory exists (28 PDFs)
- âœ… PyInstaller installed via uv
- âœ… Build scripts are executable

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Read-Only App (Optional)

Before building, you can test the read-only version:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app_readonly.py
```

This will verify that:
- The index loads correctly
- Search functionality works
- PDF rendering works
- No errors occur

Press Ctrl+C when done testing.

### 2. Build the Executable

Run the build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Verify storage and pdfs directories exist
2. Clean previous builds
3. Run PyInstaller with the correct configuration
4. Create a distributable application in `dist/`

**Build time**: 5-10 minutes (first time)  
**Output size**: ~500MB-1GB (includes Python runtime + embeddings model)

### 3. Test the Executable

**macOS:**
```bash
open dist/PDFSearch.app
```

**Expected behavior:**
- App opens in default browser
- Shows "Loading search index..."
- After a few seconds, shows the search interface
- Try a search query to verify it works

### 4. Distribute

**Create distributable archive:**

```bash
cd dist
zip -r PDFSearch-macOS.zip PDFSearch.app
```

Share `PDFSearch-macOS.zip` with users along with `QUICKSTART.md`

## Build Checklist

Before building, ensure:

- [ ] Storage directory exists (`ls storage/`)
- [ ] PDFs directory has your documents (`ls pdfs/`)
- [ ] You've tested searches work (`uv run streamlit run app.py`)
- [ ] Dependencies are installed (`uv sync`)
- [ ] Build script is executable (`chmod +x build.sh`)

## File Sizes

Your current setup:
- **PDFs**: 28 files (~varies by content)
- **Index**: ~11MB
- **Expected executable**: ~500MB-800MB compressed
  - Python runtime: ~50MB
  - Dependencies: ~100MB
  - BGE embedding model: ~400MB
  - Your PDFs + Index: ~varies
  - Streamlit + UI: ~50MB

## Troubleshooting

### "storage directory not found"
```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
# Wait for index creation, then rebuild
```

### "Permission denied" on build.sh
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

### PyInstaller errors
```bash
# Reinstall PyInstaller
uv remove pyinstaller
uv add pyinstaller
```

### Build takes very long
- Normal for first build (5-10 minutes)
- Subsequent builds are faster (~2-3 minutes)
- Most time is spent analyzing dependencies

### App won't start after build
```bash
# Test the readonly app first
uv run streamlit run app_readonly.py

# Check PyInstaller warnings
./build.sh 2>&1 | grep WARNING
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS (Your Current Platform)

**Output**: `dist/PDFSearch.app` (application bundle)

**Distribution**:
```bash
cd dist
zip -r PDFSearch-macOS.zip PDFSearch.app
```

**Code signing** (optional but recommended for distribution):
```bash
codesign --deep --force --verify --verbose \\
  --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name" \\
  dist/PDFSearch.app
```

**First run by users**: Right-click â†’ Open (to bypass Gatekeeper)

### Windows (Cross-platform build required)

You'll need a Windows machine or VM to build for Windows.

**Output**: `dist\PDFSearch\PDFSearch.exe`

**Distribution**: Zip the entire `PDFSearch` folder

### Linux (Cross-platform build required)

You'll need a Linux machine or VM to build for Linux.

**Output**: `dist/PDFSearch/PDFSearch`

**Distribution**: `tar -czf PDFSearch-Linux.tar.gz PDFSearch/`

## Advanced: Automated Multi-Platform Builds

See `PACKAGING.md` for GitHub Actions workflow example to build for all platforms automatically.

## Support

For detailed instructions, see:
- **Development & Testing**: `README.md`
- **Building & Distribution**: `PACKAGING.md`
- **End User Guide**: `QUICKSTART.md`

## Ready to Build?

If everything checks out, run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

Then test the output before distributing! ðŸš€
